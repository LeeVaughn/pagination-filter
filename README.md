# Pagination Filter

The project uses pagination and filters to improve the user experience for a website containing a list of students.

## Motivation

This is my take on the second project in the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree program from Treehouse.

## Features

* 10 students are displayed per page
* Pagination links at the bottom allow the user to move through the student list
* JavaScript is unobtrusive
* User can search for specific students by using the search bar
* If a search returns 0 results a message is displayed informing the user that no results have been found
